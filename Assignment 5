Show that the square root of 2 is irrational.
sqrt(2) = a / b
2 = a^2 / b^2
2b^2 = a^2
Since b^2 is even, a must also be even
a = 2k
Plugging back into 2 = a^2 / b^2:
2 = (2k)^2 / b^2
2b^2 = 4k^2
b^2 = 2(k^2)
b is also even
This means both a and b are divisible by 2, meaning that a and b are not in their simplest forms, meaning sqrt(2) is irrational

If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the sum of two perfect squares.
- proof by exhaustion.
n = 25, 25 = 5^2, 25 = 3^2 + 4^2
n = 100, 100 = 10^2, 100 = 8^2 + 6^2
n = 169, 169 = 13^2, 169 = 12^2 + 5^2

The sum of two odd integers is even. 
Hint: By definition, even integers can be expressed as 2n, thus odd integers can be expressed as 2n + 1
odd integer 1 = a
odd integer 2 = b
a = 2n + 1
b = 2m + 1
a + b 
2n + 1 + 2m + 1 
2(m + n + 1)
m + n + 1 = k
2k

The sum of an even integer and it's square is even
a = even integer
a = 2n
2n + (2n)^2
2n + 4n^2
2(n + 2n^2)
n + 2n^2 = k
2k

If n squared is odd, then n is odd
(2k + 1)^2 -> 2k + 1
(2k + 1)(2k + 1) -> 2k + 1
4k^2 + 4k + 1 -> 2k + 1
2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1 -> 2k + 1
p = 2k^2 + 2k
2p + 1 -> 2k + 1
 
Prove by induction that 1 + 5 + 9 + ... + (4n-3) = n(2n-1)
- Prove base case, n=1:
1 = 1(2n-1)
1 = 1
We know base case is true, make base case k and check if k+1 is true:
k(2k-1) + (4(k+1)-3) = (k+1)(2(k+1)-1)
2k^2 - k + 4k + 4 - 3 = (k+1)(2k+1)
2k^2 + 3k + 1 = 2k^2 + k +2k + 1
2k^2 + 3k + 1 = 2k^2 + 3k + 1

(1)^3 + 2(1) = 3m
3 = 3m
(k)^3 + 2k = 3m

(k+1)^3 + 2(k+1) = 3n
(k+1)(k+1)(k+1) + 2k+2 = 3n
(k^2 + 2k + 1)(k+1) + 2k+2 = 3n
k^3 + 2k^2 + k + k^2 + 2k + 1 + 2k+2 = 3n
(k^3 + 2k) + 3k^2 + 3k + 3 = 3n
3m + 3k^2 + 3k + 3 = 3n
3(m + k^2 + k + 1) = 3n

Prove that for any positive integer number n, n^3 + 2n is divisible by 3
prove base case n = 1, k^3 + 2k:
1^3 + 2n = 3, which is divisible by 3
(k+1)^3 + 2(k+1)
(k+1)(k+1)(k+1) + 2k+2
(k^2 + 2k + 1)(k+1) + 2k+2
k^3 + 2k^2 + k + k^2 + 2k + 1 + 2k+2
(k^3 + 2k) + 3k^2 + 3k + 3
(k^3 + 2k) is divisble by 3, 3k^2 + 3k + 3 is divisible by 3, so the whole thing is divisble by 3.

Prove that for n >= 1, 9^n âˆ’ 1 is divisible by 8 for all non-negative integers 
Hint: 4^(3+1) = 4 * 4^3 
Hint: If 9^n - 1 = 8m, then 9^n = 8m + 1
Prove base case n = 1:
9^1 - 1 = 8m
8 = 8m
9^k - 1 = 8m
Try to prove for k+1:
9^(k+1) - 1 = 8n
(9^k)(9^1) - 1 = 8n
9(9^k) - 1 = 8n
((9^k) - 1) / 9 = 8n / 9
8m / 9 = 8n / 9
8m = 8n
