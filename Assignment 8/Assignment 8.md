TheTrevTutor's video titled "Rules of Inference" was both helpful and interesting.
This video is located at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DW0K3mnc-0

In this video, he goes over the rules of inference. What I like about this video is that he takes the time to explain the
common sense behind the rules. He doesn't just throw all the rules at you and expect you to solve problems with them.
He makes sure to explain why these rules make sense and to give examples that are easy to grasp. The rules become
common sense instead of memorization, meaning that you become able to derive them yourself instead of just committing them to memory.
